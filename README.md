# Using Vue in Wordpress frontend üòç

I had a project with a somewhat complicated frontend - a food menu product with tons of options that affect the price etc.

I was dreading going back to jQuery...

But an idea popped into my head: why not write Vue in the PHP files?!

It sounded crazy, but the more I thought about it it made more sense...

So I got straight to work, and here it is - working!

### Built as a plugin

This is built as a plugin, but you can probably also implement it in your theme.

### Credits

I found [this post](https://dev.to/workingwebsites/using-vue-in-wordpress-1b9l) very helpful.
